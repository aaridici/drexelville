drexelville
===========

Drexelville was a game developed for Engr 103 for Freshman Engineering Design

It was developed in a few weeks with little time to work on it.

A misunderstanding arose when submitting the project. For some odd reason, the instructer asked the whole code to be printed and included in the lab report (Why waste so much paper!) and when this was not done fully (only part of the code was printed), a grade reduction was made.
